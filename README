PURPOSE AND TARGET AUDIENCE
===============
The goal of this project is to provide its users with a simple but powerful API to get information about industrial activities such as bill of materials, cost and profit or skill requirements. By hiding the complexities of EvE's static data export, iveeCore helps developers to quickly prototype scripts or develop full blown (web) applications.

iveeCore will likely be most useful for developers with at least basic PHP knowledge wanting to create their own industry related tools.


FEATURES
========
- Object oriented API to the SDE DB, no manual SQL required
- Object oriented model for inventory items
- Classes for representing manufacturing, copying, T2 invention and reaction activities, with recursive component building
- Parsers for EFT-style and EvE XML ship fittings descriptions aswell as cargo and ship scanning results
- Market data gathering via EMDR with realistic price estimation and profit calculation
- Can use caching provided by Memcached
- Extensible via configurable subclassing


REQUIREMENTS
============
For basic usage, iveeCore requires:
- PHP 5.3 (64 bit) or newer
- MySQL 5.5 or newer or derivate (MariaDB, Percona Server)
- A current EVE Static Data Export (SDE) in MySQL format

However, with just that you won't have access to the EMDR market data feed and thus lack any pricing and cost/profit calulcation capabilities, as this requires the ZMQ PHP bindings.

Since ZMQ is a not a standard module you'll need root access to whatever box you plan on running the EMDR client on. iveeCore can also easily make PHP scripts use more RAM than what is typically configured on shared hosting offers, so a VPS is likely the minimum required setup for full functionality. A VM on a desktop is fine too.
Note that the complete market data for a single region over a one year timeframe takes roughly 200MB in the database.


INSTALLATION
============
- Setting up the environment

These steps assume a Ubuntu Server 12.04 as environment, which is were the author develops and uses iveeCore. Other can probably work too, but are untested. 
Run the following command with root privileges to install the required packages:
apt-get install build-essential git mysql-server-5.5 php5-dev php5-cli php5-mysqlnd php5-curl php5-memcached libzmq1 libzmq-dev memcached re2c pkg-config gawk

If you are using MariaDB or another MySQL derivate, or have a different setup and know what your are doing, adapt the command as required.

- Compile PHP ZMQ binding

To install the PHP ZMQ binding, follow the "Building from Github" instructions found here: 
http://zeromq.org/bindings:php

Enable the freshly built extension in PHP by creating the file 
/etc/php5/conf.d/zmq.ini with the following content:
extension=zmq.so

Test it by running the command:
php -i | grep zmq
If everything went well, you should see a line with the libzmq version.

- Setting up the Static Data Export DB in MySQL

The SDE dump in MySQL format can usually be found in the Technology Lab section of the EVE Online forum, thanks to  helpful 3rd party developers like Steve Ronuken. At the time of this writing the latest conversion can be found here: 
https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&m=4329249#post4329249

Using your favorite MySQL administration tool, set up a database for the SDE and give a user full privileges to it. I use a naming scheme to reflect the current EvE expansion and version, for instance "eve_sde_rubi13". Then import the SDE SQL file into this newly created database. FYI, phpmyadmin will probably choke on the size of the file, so I recommend the CLI mysql client or something like HeidiSQL.

- Setup iveeCore

You'll probably want to git clone iveeCore directly into your project:

cd /path/to/my/project
git clone https://github.com/aineko-m/iveeCore.git

Once you've done this, you'll find the directory 'iveeCore'. Import the file iveeCore/sql/iveeCore_tables_and_SP.sql into the same database you set up for the SDE. This will create the tables iveeCore uses, stored procedures and add some missing indices in the SDE tables to improve performance.
This package also comes with sample market data to allow for some experiments without having to set up ZMQ/EMDR. To use this data, unzip the file iveeCore/sql/iveeCore_sample_market_data_2013_11_02.zip and import the extracted SQL file into the database. Note this data covers only the region "The Forge" over the period of one week and is not garanteed to be complete or correct.

Make a copy of the file iveeCoreConfig_template.php, naming it iveeCoreConfig.php and edit the configuration to match your environment. 
iveeCore comes with a lot of default variables describing an industrial setup in eve, defined in IveeCoreDefaults.php.Once you get comfortable using iveeCore you'll want to customize these defaults, to be done in MyIveeCoreDefaults.php, which extends the IveeCoreDefaults class and thus allows you to overwrite whichever aspect is required. The variables are commented or should be self-explanatory to an EvE industrialist or developer.

To test the setup try running the EMDR client:

php iveeCore/emdr.php

If everything is fine, you should see IDs of items for which price and history market data is being updated as it comes in. Ctrl+C to cancel. You'll want to setup this script to run in the background to have up-to-date market data available in iveeCore at all times.

Note that EMDR relays can change, so visit https://eve-market-data-relay.readthedocs.org/en/latest/access.html and pick the one nearest to you and change iveeCoreConfig.php accordingly.


UPGRADING SDE
=============
Whenever you want to upgrade to another SDE, the following steps are recommended:
- Create a new database and set up permissions for it
- Import the new SDE into this new database
- Import iveeCore_tables_and_SP.sql into it
- Copy the contents of the tables iveePrices and iveeTrackedPrices from the old database to the new
- Adapt iveeCoreConfig.php to the new database
- if using memcached, flush it


USAGE
=====
Please take a look at the class diagram in iveeCore/doc/iveeCore_class_diagram.pdf and familiarize yourself with the iveeCore object model. iveeCore provides a simple but powerful API. Once configured, one can use it as demonstrated by the following examples:

<?php
//include and initialize iveeCore. Adapt path if required.
require_once('iveeCoreConfig.php');

//get SDE object
$sde = SDE::instance();

//show the object for 'Damage Control I'
print_r($sde->getType(2046));

//it's also possible to instantiate type objects by name
$type = $sde->getTypeByName('Damage Control I');

//manufacture 5 units of 'Damage Control I' with ME 20 and PE 10
$manuData = $type->getBlueprint()->manufacture(5, 20, 10);

//show the ManufactureProcessData object
print_r($manuData);

//print materials, cost and profits for this process
$manuData->printData();

//get the data for making a max run Damage Control I BPC copy, inventing from it with a 
//decryptor and building from the resulting T2 BPC, recursively building the necessary 
//components
$processData = $sde->getTypeByName('Damage Control II Blueprint')->copyInventManufacture(21583, 'max', true);

//get the raw profit for running an Unrefined Hyperflurite Reaction for 30 days, taking
//into account the refining and material feedback steps
$reactionProcessData = $sde->getTypeByName('Unrefined Hyperflurite Reaction')->react(24 * 30, true, true);
print_r($reactionProcessData->getProfit());

?>

NOTES
=====
Although I tried to make iveeCore as configurable as possible, there are still a number of underlying assumptions made and caveats:
- For profit calculations, it is assumed you buy items using buy orders; you sell your products with sell orders with competitive pricing in the default region configured in (My)IveeCoreDefaults.php
- The prices of items that can't be sold on the market also can't be determined. This includes BPCs (The _cost_ of copying, inventing or researching a BPC can and is calculated for processes, however).
- Calculated material amounts might be fractions, which is due to damage, invention chance or (hypothetical) production batches in non-multiples of portionSize. These should be treated as the average required or consumed when doing multiple production batches.
- While the class model is a decent match for EvE's items, it is by no means perfect. For instance, you'll find Manufacturable and Blueprint objects which can't be sold on the market although they inherit from Sellable.
- The EMDR client does some basic filtering on the incoming market data, but there is no measure against malicious clients uploading fake data
- (My)IveeCoreDefaults.php contains functions for setting and looking up default BPO ME and PE levels. Also see EXTENDING iveeCore below.

Generals notes:
- Remember to restart or flush memcached after making changes to type classes. From the terminal you can do so with a command like: echo 'flush_all' | nc localhost 11211
- iveeCore is under active development so I can't promise the API will be stable.
- When iveeCore is updated, be sure to read HISTORY for changes that might affect your application or setup


EXTENDING iveeCore
==================
To extend iveeCore to your needs, the suggested way of doing so is to use subclassing, creating new classes inheriting from the iveeCore classes, and changing the configuration (iveeCoreConfig::classes). Class names are looked up dynamically, so with the adjustment objects from your classes will get instantiated instead.
You can modify iveeCore directly, however, you'll need to comply with the LGPL and release your modifications under the same license. Also you'll have more work maintaining and applying patches to iveeCore when updates are released.


FUTURE PLANS
============
Things I'm considering implementing in iveeCore are T3 production chains, something for calculating ore compression and more generic features. I'll try to keep improving iveeCores structuring, API and test coverage. I also want to write a more comprehensive manual. I'm open to suggestions and will also consider patches for inclusion. If you find bugs, have any other feedback or are "just" a user, please post in this thread: https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&t=292458


FAQ
===
Q: What were the beginnings of iveeCore?
A: In early 2012 I began writing my own indy application in PHP. I had been using the Invention Calculator Plugin (http://oldforums.eveonline.com/?a=topic&threadID=1223530) for EvEHQ, but with the author going AFG and the new EvEHQ v2 having a good but not nearly flexible enough calculator for my expanding industrial needs, I decided to build my own. The application called "ivee" grew over time and well beyond the scope of it's predecessor. In the end it was rewritten from scratch two and a half times, until I was happy with the overall structure. 
Eventually I decided I wanted to release the part of the code that provided general useful functionality, without revealing too much of ivee's secret sauce. So I put in some effort into separating and generalizing the code dealing with SDE DB interaction and Type classes into the library which now is iveeCore.

Q: What's the motivation for releasing iveeCore?
A: I wanted to share something back to the eve developer community. I also see it as an opportunity to dip my toes into working on a Github hosted project, even if it is a small one.

Q: Are you going to release ivee proper?
A: No.

Q: Why Memcache?
A: I wanted to use APC first, but APC caches do not persist across CLI PHP program runs, so it was pointless. Memcache is probably the most commonly used cache for PHP and it works with both web-served and CLI scripts. It should be trivial to add other key-value or object stores, though.

Q: Why use EMDR if so much data is filtered out?
A: I'd happily use a pre-filtered EMDR stream to reduce traffic, and this has been requested on the EMDR mailing list, but the developers so far have declined.
Other market data sources could only be used if they'd provide actual order data, as it's needed to calculate some of the more interesting indices in iveeCore.
