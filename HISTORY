This file lists major changes in iveeCore versions.

Version 1.2 - February 8, 2014
--------------
- Added reaction calculations
- Rewrote type materials and requirements handling. This fixed reprocessing calculations and most off-by-1 errors. The 
memory use of the type array was reduced by up to 30%. The stored procedure iveeGetRequirements() is obsoleted by this 
change, which makes for more maintainable code.
- Bug fixes and more convenience functions
- Renamed MaterialSet to MaterialMap and SkillSet to SkillMap as it better describes the classes purpose
- Renamed CopyData to CopyProcessData, InventionData to InventionProcessData and ManufactureData to 
ManufactureProcessData for concistency
- Added some PHPUnit test cases covering different parts of iveeCore
- Note that the file iveeCoreConfig_template.php changed, thus adaptation of the configuration file is required
