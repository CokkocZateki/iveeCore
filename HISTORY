This file lists major changes in iveeCore versions.

Version 1.4.1 - Juli 14, 2014
-----------------------------
- Fixed faulty SQL queries in the EMDR client
- Throw exceptions on SQL errors
- Print type and region names in the EMDR client for incoming data

Version 1.4 - July 11, 2014
---------------------------
- Refactored EMDR client: Multi region support, reduce memory usage, avoid id autoincrement inflation
- Replaced SDE->printDbStats() with getStats()
- Replaced DB hack for vol and tx weekly averages, DB schema changed as a result; DB migration provided
- Note that the file iveeCoreConfig_template.php changed, thus adaptation of the configuration file is required

Version 1.3.1 - June 8, 2014
----------------------------
- Adapted README, the configuration template and the unit test to Kronos 1.0.
- Added bash script to restart the EMDR client

Version 1.3 - March 29, 2014
----------------------------
- Added parsers for EFT-style and EvE's XML fitting descriptions as well as cargo and ship scanning results.
- Reworked how configuration & defaults and utility methods are organized, for cleaner separation and better 
consistency. Defaults now reside in IveeCoreDefaults.php and customization is done in the subclass/file 
MyIveeCoreDefaults.php. As a consequence, iveeCoreConfig_template.php also changed a lot, therefore configuration files 
will have to be redone.
- Adapted README to Rubicon 1.3 release
- More bugfixes and unit tests

------------------------------
- Added reaction calculations
- Rewrote type materials and requirements handling. This fixed reprocessing calculations and most off-by-1 errors. The 
memory use of the type array was reduced by up to 30%. The stored procedure iveeGetRequirements() is obsoleted by this 
change, which makes for more maintainable code.
- Bug fixes and more convenience functions
- Renamed MaterialSet to MaterialMap and SkillSet to SkillMap as it better describes the classes purpose
- Renamed CopyData to CopyProcessData, InventionData to InventionProcessData and ManufactureData to 
ManufactureProcessData for consistency
- Added some PHPUnit test cases covering different parts of iveeCore
- Note that the file iveeCoreConfig_template.php changed, thus adaptation of the configuration file is required
